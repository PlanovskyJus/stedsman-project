# README

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version - ruby 2.4.0p0 (2016-12-24 revision 57164)

* System dependencies - rails

This project is a remake of the SEHS newspaper website. I am creating all of this from scratch using Ruby on Rails. 

LATEST VERSION INCLUDES:
-a cleaner system made with rails scaffolds
-tag system now uses belongs_to instead of through a taggings model.
-can search database through the web interface for posts that contain keywords in the title and have certain tags.
-tags can be created on their own web interface page.
-CSS needs to be re-applied as all of it was removed when creating the new project files.
