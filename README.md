Stedsman Versions:

Pre-Alpha Version 1.0 -
  User and post models in use. Users can view the posts
  only the admin user can create and delete posts.
  -admin only can view the delete button.
  Posts can be filtered by tags. Posts can have one of two
  pre-set radio button tags or for now can be custom made tags.

Pre-Alpha Version 1.3 -
  Committed with a new commenting model. Comments can be created through a form rendered on the show of the post. Comments are sorted by user_id and post_id. However, the rendering of the comments will not work as of now because of a undefined local variable or method that I cannot determine the cause of.
